\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

Motivation for this work stemmed from \texttt{BUNDLE}-based
thread-level schedulers limitation of a single task and single
job. The primary goal is to create a multi-task scheduling technique
and schedulability test for those \texttt{BUNDLE}-based thread-level
schedulers which leverages without decreasing the inter-thread cache
benefit.

In addition to achieving the primary goal, the scheduling technique
and schedulability test developed for the multi-task
\texttt{BUNDLE}-based scheduled has been simplified to strictly
increasing discrete concave WCET functions. This allows any compatible
thread-level scheduling technique to benefit from the \tpj{} approach
developed in this work. As a non-preemptive multi-threaded
schedulability test \tpj{} is optimal with respect to
npm-feasibility, always producing a feasible task set if one is
schedulable by non-preemptive EDF.

For future work, the primary focus is upon a fully or limited preemption
scheduling algorithm that permits the inter-thread cache benefit of
\texttt{BUNDLE}-based schedulers and other schedulers
characterized by concave growth to retain their thread-level
scheduling benefits.
