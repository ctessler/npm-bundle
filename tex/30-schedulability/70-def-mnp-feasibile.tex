Non-preemptive EDF scheduling of jobs of multiple threads ordered by a
thread-level scheduler (such as \bundle{} or \bundlep{}) allows
preemptions between threads of the same job but precludes preemptions
between jobs. Each task benefits from the advantages of thread-level
scheduling by the exclusive use of the processor and shared
resources. Since task set specifications may be divided, a
specification is feasible when threads of the specification \ants{}
may be assigned to tasks such that the posterior task set \tasks{} is
feasible by EDF-NP. 

\begin{definition}[npm-feasible]
  A task set specification \ants{} is task-level non-preemptive
  multi-threaded feasible (\emph{npm-feasible}) if there exists a
  posterior task set \tasks{} of \ants{} such that all multi-threaded
  jobs scheduled by EDF-NP will always meet their deadlines. 
\end{definition}
